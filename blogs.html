  <h2><b>What are the Indian laws on smoking in public places?</b></h2>
  <p><b>Submission By: Pankhuri Pankaj</b><br></p>

<p align="justify">The simple activity of inhaling and exhaling the fumes of various plant material like marijuana, hashish, and tobacco, is called smoking. These plants are usually smoked in a cigar, cigarette, or pipe and this act came into practice by the American Indians first. The reason behind the fast addiction towards smoking is the presence of nicotine in tobacco which both stimulates and tranquilizes psychoactive effects which is addictive. In India every third person in a group five is found to be a smoker. From young adults to senior citizens, every age group has a significant amount of smokers available in India. <br><br>

This hazardous activity has spiked the rate of respiratory diseases leading to death and contributed to air pollution too, which is a major global issue in today’s world. The unfortunate part is that the non-smokers are getting wrapped up in the havoc created by the smoking community due to the unwanted passive smoking they are subjected to. The inhalation of Environmental Tobacco smoke (ETS) or Secondhand Smoke (SHS) is equally injurious to health for the people who end up passive smoking.<br><br>

This health crisis borne by the smoking community against the non-smoking community is a case of public nuisance that needed immediate attention. The duty of the justice system is to make sure no person is discriminated against. To safeguard the non-smoking community from the unjustified discrimination, the anti-smoking laws were established. <br><br>

For the first time the hazardous effects of smoking in public were ever discussed in the country in the case of Murli S Deora v. Union of India  where the harmful and dangerous effects of passive smoking were addressed for the first time and the Supreme Court recognised the absence of any statutory provisions regarding this problem. The court held that smoking in public places like railways, public offices, hospitals, auditoriums, court buildings, libraries, and other public places will be banned.<br><br>

The Section 4 of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA), enacted in 2003, prohibits smoking at public places and came into application on 2nd October 2008. A public place in general terms is any place where the public has access like: hospitals, markets, public offices,  auditoriums, hotels, restaurants, etc. and also includes open spaces like parks. Section 4 of the COTPA prohibits any person from smoking in these areas and disrupting the peace of the people around them. If a person is found guilty under this section their case is tried in accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The wrong done under this COTPA is bailable and Compoundable in nature and it is tried according to the provisions of the summary trials. There is another provision which provides for a Rs. 200 fine against the offender and currently an amendment bill has been put up in the Parliament by the Government where this fine has been raised to Rs. 1000.<br><br>

On February 27, 2005, the country became a party to the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and along with the regulatory acts and provisions brought changes in few existing rules too. The Health Ministry decided to raise the age from 18 to 21 as the legal age to buy any tobacco related product and this has been incorporated in the act too. In addition various guidelines have been laid out too to avoid any ambiguity regarding smoking in public and helping the society live in harmony and peace. 
The High Court of Kerala for the first time in the history of the world made smoking an illegal act and stated that it is violative of the Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which is one the fundamental rights, and hence held it to be unconstitutional. Later cities like Chandigarh and Shimla took the initiative to go smoke free and hopefully the rest of the country will be soon following this noble cause too.

<h2><b>THE DOCTRINE OF JUDICIAL REVIEW IN INDIA</b></h2><br>
 <p><b>Submission By:Pankhuri Pankaj</b><br><br>
<p align="justify"><b>INTRODUCTION</b><br>

Article 13 of the Indian Constitution states the compulsion of judicial review as described the fundamental rights in Part III. It has been laid down that neither the state nor the Union shall make any such rules that may take away or abridge the essential rights of the people of the country. Judicial Review is an asset recognized as a basic and vital requirement for the construction of a novel civilization in order to safeguard the liberty and rights of the individualsand it is vested significantly on the High Courts and the Supreme Courts of India. It is the power of Courts to pronounce upon the constitutionality of legislative and executive acts of the government which fall within their normal jurisdiction and any law made by the Parliament or the state legislature will be considered void if it contravenes the provisions of the article under the fundamental rights. One can understand judicial review can be as a court proceeding where the lawfulness of a decision or action is reviewed, usually held in the Administrative Court, by the Hon'ble Judge.<br><br>

When the constitutional values are harmed by either the Legislative, Executive, or the Judiciary, and any right that been made definite to the inhabitants of the country by the Indian Constitution have been, judicial review plays a crucial role in providing relief and acts as a protector safeguarding the well justified rights of the citizens. Whether the laws have been correctly applied and whether the right procedures have been followed is the concern behind filing for a judicial review. Judicial Review is made available as remedy in cases where no effective means of challenge is left with the aggrieved party.<br><br>

It is important to note that under Article 246 and Schedule 7 of the Constitution of India the working zone of the regulation construction between the state and the center has been marked which can be referred to in case any difficulty arises between the state and the center.<br><br> 
<b>EVOLUTION OF JUDICIAL REVIEW</b><br><br>

For the first time ever the Doctrine of Judicial Review was propounded by the Supreme Court of America. Even though the Constitution of America did not expressly provide a provision regarding judicial review but the hon'ble Supreme Court of America assumed this doctrine in the case of Marbury v Madison.<br><br>

In India the Doctrine of Judicial Review was being practiced even before the Constitution of India was implemented, thanks to the British Parliament which through the Government of India Act, 1935 introduced the Federal System in India gave both, the center and the state, separate plenary powers in there own territories. This Federal system was to function as an arbiter in the central and state relationship and to inspect any violation of the Constitutional guidance in the distribution of powers. Here, the doctrine of Judicial Review was not discussed explicitly but with the constitution being federal now the court was indirectly held liable with the function of interpreting the constitution and determining the constitutionality of various legislative acts passed.<br><br> 

This system was followed in India for a significant time and was able to uphold its dignity through various constitutional decisions dealt by the Federal Court of India and the High Courts. Later, this system was inherited by the Supreme Court from its predecessor because the wise constitution makers were of the view that the Supreme Court of India should be graced with the power of judicial review.<br><br> 

If one was to look over the evolution of judicial review from a broader perspective, this doctrine has evolved into three dimensions, which are:<br><br>

- Protection of essential rights provided under Part III of the Constitution of India.<br><br> 

- Authorization of the disinterest of organizational achievements.<br><br>

- Interrogating the interest of the public.<br><br>

<b>JUDICIAL REVIEW IN INDIA</b><br><br>

A very adaptable and healthy system of judicial review has been envisaged by the constitution of India where the duty to maintain the spirit is on the Indian Judges. The courts have been granted a wide range of power of judicial review by the statutory and constitutional provisions and these provision judicial review by the constitution and statutes are very different from each other and the court has the responsibility to practice these powers with great caution and self-control has to be practiced. Phasing out from the boundaries of appropriate influences of judicial assessment that has been laid down is not expected from the courts at any cost.<br><br> 

In the current democratic pattern in the country the courts are not expected to ask the aggrieved party to wait for the the opinion of the public against the tyranny of the legislative and take up a passive attitude, but it has been empowered by the constitution to perform a more active role and, if there's a violation of the constitution, declare the legislation void for being ultra vires.<br><br>

In India the Doctrine of Judicial Review plays a very important role to assess in case either the legislature, executive, or the judiciary harms the values of the constitution of India or denies the rights of the citizens. Since, a Parliamentary form of government exists in the country, in the process of decision making and policy making every section of people are involved. The groundwork of social equity is the application of rules which is the primary duty of the court. Everyone who is invested in public duty can be held accountable and they are obligated to work within the democratuc provisions provided under the Constitution of India. Under Article 226 and 227, and Article 32 and 136 the influence of Judicial assessment has been laid down in case of a High Court or the Supreme Court, respectively.<br><br>

One may say the concept of Separation of Power and Rule of Law is Judicial review itself in India. <br><br>

In India, the fundamental subjects of Judicial review relate to<br><br>

1.  Violation of fundamental rights.<br><br>

2.  Violation of various other constitutional restrictions embodied in the constitution.<br><br>
3.  Enactment of legislative act in violation of constitutional mandates regarding distribution of powers.<br><br>
4.  Delegation of essential legislative power by the legislature to the executive or any other body.<br><br>
5.  Violation of implied limitations and restrictions.<br><br>
<b>MECHANISM OF JUDICIAL REVIEW IN INDIA</b><br><br>

Three aspects are covered by judicial review in India.<br><br>

1.  The Judicial review of Legislative actions.<br><br>
2.  The Judicial review of Judicial actions<br><br>
3.  The Judicial review of Administrative Actions.<br><br>

In the case of L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India ((1997) 3 SCC 261), the Supreme Court discussed these facets of judicial review and stated that the legislation have to be interpreted by the High Courts to the limit that the Constitutional values are not disrupted, and in order to achieve this end the Judges need to keep in mind that equilibrium of control, which has been specified in the Constitution of India, should not be disturbed.<br><br>
<b>ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA</b><br><br>

An express provision for Judicial Review has been provided under Article 13 of the Constitution of India. It provides for the judicial review of legislations of India and is applicable in a retrospective manner as well. It confers the right on the High Court and Supreme Court of India to declare any legislation unconstitutional if it is held inconsistent with any provision of Part III of the Constitution. It entitles the court to strike down or declare any law void under Article 13(2) if it abridges any fundamental right.<br><br> 

In the case of A. K. Gopalan v. State of Madras (AIR 1950 SC 27), the court held that all laws must be in conformity with the constitution and it is on the judiciary to decide whether any enactment is constitutional or not, and a similar idea was held in the case of State of Madras v. V. G. Row (AIR 1952 SC 196), as well.<br><br>

<b>SOME IMPORTANT JUDICIAL PRONOUNCEMENTS TO FOLLOW</b><br><br>

In the case of Shankari Prasad v Union of India (AIR 1951 SC 458), it was held by the six judge bench out of which five judges did not agree to amending the essential rights provided in the Indian Constitution, however, in the case of Keshavananda Bharati v State of Kerala (AIR 1973 SC 1461) overruling the Golaknath v. State of Punjab case, six out of seven judges held that modifying influence the Parliament has and all portions of the Constitution can be amended. The Supreme Court held that the essential rights cannot be modified.<br><br>

After taking inference from cases like Keshavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, Minerva Mills Ltd. and ors. v. Union of India (AIR 1980 SC 1789), Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975), and Chandra Kumar v. Union of India and Ors. (AIR 1997 SC 1125), in R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu (AIR 2007 SC 861), it was held that Judicial Review is an integral part of the constitution.<br><br>

Some other landmark cases which further illustrate the importance of Judicial Review are: Brij Bhurshan v. State of Delhi (AIR 1950 SC 129), Ramesh Thapper v. State of Madras (AIR 1950 SC 124), Sajjan Singh vs State of Rajasthan (AIR 1965 SC 845), ADM Jabalpur v. Shivakant Shukla (AIR 1976 SC 1207), S.P Sampat Kumar v. Union of India (AIR 1987 SC 386), Shayara Bano v. Union Of India (W.P.No. 118 of 2016),  Joseph Shine v. Union of India (AIR 2018), Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India (2020 SC), and P.U.C.L v. U. O. I (AIR 1997 SC 568).<br><br>

To conclude, over the years judicial review has presumed a permanent status by the means of judicial decisions and is a part of the basic structure of the constitution of India, thus, it cannot be done away with but has to be understood as a very important in maintaining a harmony and keeping a restrain on the actions of the executive, legislative, and judicial government bodies.<br><br>

<h2><b>Is a Creating Fake Facebook Account a punishable Offence?    </b></h2>
 <p><b>Submission By:Pankhuri Pankaj</b><br>
</p>
<p align="justify">Fake profiles are a common sight to come across on social networking websites. Facebook is one of the biggest platforms to come across a fake account. A fake account is an online profile made by someone trying to impersonate another person. These accounts are often made with the purpose of harassing other people, for spreading spam as well as viruses to steal private data, and the most common purpose is to take revenge on other people and uploading malicious photos. With the country becoming more equipped with the services of the internet the cases of fake profiles are piling up at an increasing rate. With the alarming increase in fake accounts, the real question stands: whether creating a fake Facebook account is a punishable offence? In India, there are various remedies available by the law for the inconvenience caused by these fake accounts. <br><br>
It is necessary to first distinguish whether the fake account was made up of a person who exists in reality or it was a random fake account in order to hold a person liable for punishment. Section 66D of the Information Technology Act of 2000  states that a person will be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term extending to three years and shall also be liable to fine which may extend to one lakh rupees if they cheat by personating through the means of any communication device like a computer. To hold the person responsible one of the most important ingredient is that the person must cheat or the person who created the fake account must gain a pecuniary benefit from it. 
Under Section 468  of the Indian Penal Code 1863, a person shall be punished with imprisonment of either description that may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine if they commit the offence of forgery intending that the document or electronic record forged were used for the purpose of cheating.<br><br>
Under Section 67  of the Information Technology Act of 2000, any material which appeals to be of prurient interest or if its effect is such as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely, having regard to all relevant circumstances, to read, see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it or any lascivious material is published or transmitted or caused to be published or transmitted by a person, such person shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years and with fine which may extend to five lakh rupees on the first conviction, and in case of a second or subsequent conviction will be subjected to imprisonment of either description extending a term of five years and with a fine that can extend to ten lakh rupees.<br><br>
Under Section 67A of Information Technology Act of 2000, punishment for publishing or transmitting sexually explicit material in electronic form has been stated. Any sexually explicit act or material or conduct published or transmitted or caused to be published or transmitted by a person, such person shall be awarded with imprisonment of either description which may extend to five years and with fine up to ten lakh rupees on the first conviction, and on a second and subsequent conviction the person is sentenced to imprisonment of either description which may extend to seven years and fine up to ten lakh rupees.<br><br>
The offender can be punished in case of a pecuniary benefit under Section 419 of the IPC as well with the same qualification applied.<br><br>
Since the creator of the fake account can be said to be producing false electronic records with the intention to cause damage or injury, such person can be convicted under forgery which is defined under Section 465 of the IPC and shall be awarded the punishment of imprisonment for a description which may extend to two years and will be liable to a fine as well.
The aggrieved party can file a complaint before the Adjudicating officer appointed under the IT Act, who is generally the Chief Secretary or the Secretary of Information Technology Department of the respective state, in case of falling prey to these offences. This application has to be filed within 4 months and needs to be heard within the same time period. The whole of the issue has to be heard decided within the time period of 6 months.

  <h2><b>HOW TO FILE CASES BEFORE CONSUMER FORUM WITHOUT AN ADVOCATE</b></h2>
  <p><b>-Submission By: Pankhuri Pankaj</b></p><br>
  <p align="justify">The purpose of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (CPA) is to provide for the better protection of the interests of the consumers (defined u/S2(d) of CPA) and for that purpose to make provisions for the establishment of consumer councils and other authorities for the settlement of consumers' disputes and for matters connected within. In the past years the number of cases filed under the consumer forum have risen significantly, yet many issues stay unattended due to the unwanted hassle of hiring an advocate by the aggrieved party. But in 2011 the Supreme Court ruled that a non-lawyers can represent, appear and argue cases filed under the CPA in a Consumer Forum while dismissing an eight-year-old appeal filed by the Bar Council of India against a 2002 Bombay high court judgment that permitted agents to represent consumers. To file a case under Consumer Forum without an Advocate the representative must fulfill the following steps: <br>
The First Step is to understand the jurisdiction of the case. There are three levels at which a consumer can file a case. (i) There is a District Forum for every district and it settles disputes in its jurisdiction involving claims of up to Rs. 20 lakh. (ii) Then comes the State Commission which hears cases where the value of the claim is between Rs. 20 lakh and Rs. 1 crore and those cases within the state which have been appealed against the District Forum’s decision. (iii) At last comes  The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) which hears cases that have been appealed against the decision of the State Commission and those in which the claimed sum exceeds Rs. 1 crore.<br>
The Second Step is to Draft a complaint which must include: important facts to establish some harm has been suffered by the consumer due to the faulty good bought or service availed from the defendant; name, despcription and address of the consumer and the defendant (against whom the case has been filed); the relief or compensation one would like to claim. 
It is advised to get the complaint typed out on  a legal size type paper measuring 356x216mm. It should be double spaced, with atleast 1.5 inches of margin space on the left, top and bottom.<br>
The Third Step is to Attach relevant documents like: copy of the bill, warranty or guarantee certificate, and a copy of the written complaint or notice sent to the defendant. These documents may help support the case in the court.
The Fourth Step is to Pay requisite court fees. Court Fee is the fee which maybe imposed upon a litigant in order to begin a lawsuit or start a legal dispute resolution case. This is to be payed along with the complaint filed and its value depends on the value of good bought and the amount of compensation sought. The court fee differs from court to court.<br>
Before the District Forum:<br><br> 
- For claims upto Rs 1 Lakh = Rs. 100<br><br>
- For claims from Rs. 1 Lakh to 5 Lakhs = Rs. 200<br><br>
- For claims from Rs. 5 Lakhs to 10 Lakhs = Rs. 400<br><br>
- For claims from Rs. 10 Lakhs to 20 Lakhs = Rs. 500<br><br>
Before the State Commission: <br><br>
- For claims from Rs 20 Lakhs to Rs. 50 Lakhs = Rs. 2000<br><br>
- For claims from Rs. 50 Lakhs to Rs. 1 Crore = Rs. 4000<br><br>
Before the National Commission: <br><br>
- For claims exceeding Rs. 1 Crore = Rs. 5000<br><br>
The fee has to be paid in the form of a Demand Draft (DD) on a nationalized bank in favour of the President of the concerned Forum.<br> <br>
The Fifth Step is to Submit an Affidavit which states that the facts presented and statements made by the consumer are true to their knowledge. This affidavit is to be on an oath basis and need not be notarized by a notary.<br><br> 
Another fact to be kept in mind is the time duration, which is of two years from the date of grievance, within which the case needs to be filed.<br><br> 
All the pages should be numbered in the complaint and it has to be arranged in the following order : 
(1) Index (giving page number of each document).<br><br>
(2) Application for condonation of delay, if there is delay, giving the reasons for the delay duly affirmed before a notary public.<br><br>
(3) The complaint draft, as discussed in the second step.<br><br>
(4) Affidavit, as discussed in the fifth step.<br><br>
(5) Copies of all the required relevant documents, as discussed in the third step.<br><br>
One original and two xerox copies of the complaint are to be submitted and further if the complaint gets accepted, copies of the complaint are to be submitted to the defendant(s) as well.<br><br>

                  <h2><b>Hiral P. Harsora And Ors vs Kusum Narottamdas Harsora And Ors</b></h2>
                  <p><b>Brief Facts of the Case</b></p><br><br>
                  <p align="justify">
                    • The present appeal arises out of a judgment dated 25.9.2014 of a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court.<br><br>
• Here on 3.4.2007, Kusum Narottam Harsora and her mother Pushpa Narottam Harsora filed a complaint under the 2005 Act against their brother/son, his wife and two sisters/daughters, alleging various acts of violence against them. No action was taken on the fresh complaints that were filed subsequently. Nothing happened for a period of three years till both of the complainants filed separate complaints in October, 2010.<br><br>
• The main issue here was the interpretation of a section 2(q) of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, (hereinafter referred to as “the DV Act”). The particular section defined the term “respondents” for the purpose of this act.<br><br>
• The Bombay High Court construed the provision in its literal sense and discharged the three female respondents from the complaint, as they concluded that the complaint could be filed only against an “adult male person”.<br><br>
• The present case deals with the writ petition filed by the mother and daughter duo in which the constitutional validity of Section 2(q) has been challenged, with no prayer seeking any interference with the order given in their previous case.<br><br>

<b>Issues before the court</b><br><br>
• Whether Section 2(q) of the DV Act violates Article 14 of the Constitution?<br><br>
• Whether the rest of the DV Act can remain in force if amendments are made in respect of Section 2(q)? <br><br>

<b>Ratio of the case</b><br><br>
• The court referred to the judgment of Shashikant Laxman Kale v. Union of India  and observed that it is first necessary to discern the true purpose or object of the impugned enactment because it is only with reference to the true object of the enactment that the existence of a rational nexus of the differentia on which the classification is based, with the object sought to be achieved by the enactment, can be examined to test the validity of the classification.<br><br>
• The court observed that the main object of the DV Act as reflected by its preamble is “An Act to provide for more effective protection of the rights of women guaranteed under the constitution who are victims of violence of any kind occurring within the family and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.”<br><br>
• This court explained, gives a clarity as to the legislative intent of covering all sorts of violence against women in a domestic space and its necessary application on all the perpetrators and abettors, be it women themselves.<br><br>
• The court further analyzed the different provisions and remedies under the act and concluded that how each of them fails to cover their objective if they are to be considered only in respect of an adult male person. This was mainly concluded as, exclusion of the female members of the household gives the opportunity to subject women to violence where an adult male person might not stand in the forefront, but put forward female members who can therefore harm or exclude the aggrieved person from the shared household with no complaints against them under this act.<br><br>
• Also in cases of Monetary Relief Order and Protection Order, under section 20 and section 19 respectively, the remedies will not be fruitful as the same cannot be enforced against the female members of the shared household.<br><br>
• The court further explained as to how the phrase “adult male members” also reduced its scope and unreasonably excluded the ‘non-adult males’, who can aid or abet the commission of acts of domestic violence, or who can evict or help in evicting or excluding from a shared household an aggrieved person.<br><br>
• The court further dealt with some cases of Article 14 including Lachhman Dass v. State of Punjab , with which they explained that in the present case, the classification of “adult male person” clearly subverts the doctrine of equality.<br><br>
• The court observed that the microscopic difference between male and female, adult and non adult, regard being had to the object sought to be achieved by the 2005 Act, is neither real or substantial nor does it have any rational relation to the object of the legislation. In fact, as per the principle settled in the Subramanian Swamy judgment , the words “adult male person” are contrary to the object of affording protection to women who have suffered from domestic violence “of any kind”.<br><br>
• Further after striking down the words “adult male” before the word “person” in Section 2(q), dealing with the second issue the court analyzed the Doctrine of Severability which was propounded in the R.M.D. Chamarbaugwalla v. Union of India  in reference to various other judgments. <br><br>
• Further, the court explained and gained more clarity as to the legislative intent in respect of the interpretation the word respondent by referring to the Protection from Domestic Violence Bill, 2002 which had lapsed in the Parliament. The 2002 Bill defined “respondent” as meaning “any person who is…..” without the addition of the words “adult male”, being in consonance with the object sought to be achieved by the Bill, which was pari materia with the object sought to be achieved by the DV Act.<br><br>

<b>Decision of the Court</b><br><br>
• The court concluded that Section 2(q) of the DV Act violates Article 14 of the constitution and struck down the words “adult male” before the word “person” in the particular section. Consequently, the proviso to Section 2(q), being rendered otiose, was automatically deleted.<br><br>
• The court held the rest of the act to be operative and that the same can be enforced to achieve the object of the legislation without the offending words. <br>

                  <h2>BHAGAT RAM v. TEJA SINGH (2002 1 SCC 210)</h2>
                  <p align="justify"><b>Facts:</b><br>
One Kehar Singh was the owner of the land admeasuring 280 kanals and 18 marlas in Village Antowali (now in Pakistan). He died prior to partition of India. His widow, Smt Kirpo and two daughters Smt Santi and Smt Indro migrated to India. In lieu of the property owned by Kehar Singh in Pakistan, his widow, Kirpo was allotted some land in India. Kirpo died on 25-12-1951 leaving behind her two daughters, Smt Santi and Smt Indro. They inherited the property equally. Smt Santi died in 1960. The property left by her was thereafter mutated in the name of her surviving sister, Smt Indro. The original appellant, Bhagat Ram (deceased) who had entered into an agreement with Smt Indro on 12-3-1963, filed a suit for specific performance, which was decreed in his favour. The original respondent in the appeal, Shri Teja Singh (deceased) is the brother of Smt Santi‘s predeceased husband. He filed a suit alleging that, on the death of Smt Santi in 1960, the property in question devolved on him by virtue Section 15(1)(b)  of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. The trial court decreed the suit filed by Teja Singh. The appeal filed against the said decree was dismissed. Bhagat Ram (deceased) then preferred the second appeal before the High Court, which was also dismissed. The High Court held that the property held by Smt Santi on her death devolved to Teja Singh who was the brother of the predeceased husband of Smt Santi. However, on appeal, this Court by its judgment dated 31-3-1999 held that the property held by Smt Santi was the property inherited by her from her mother; therefore, Section 15(2)(a)  is the relevant provision which governed the succession and Teja Singh had no right in the property left by Smt Santi and that it would only devolve on her sister Smt Indro. <br><br>  
 
The counsel for the respondent contended that Smt Santi acquired property from her mother Smt Kirpo who died on 25-12-1951 and at that time Smt Santi had only a limited right over this property, but by virtue of Section 14(1)  of the Hindu Succession Act, she became the full owner of the property and, therefore, on her death, the property held by her would be inherited by her legal heirs as per the rule set out in Section 15(1) of the Act. He further added that prior to the Hindu Succession Act, Smt Santi had only a limited right but for Section 14(1) of the Act, it would have reverted to the reversioners and such a limited right became a full right and, therefore, the property is to be treated as her own property. He also contended that Section 15 of the Hindu Succession Act will have only prospective operation and, therefore, the words used in Section 15(2)(a) viz. ―any property inherited by a female Hindu‖ are to be construed as property inherited by a female Hindu after the commencement of the Act.<br><br>

A question of similar nature was considered by this Court in <b>Bajaya v. Gopikabai</b> . In that case, the suit land originally belonged to G, son of D. G died before the settlement of 1918 and thereafter, his land was held by his son, P who died in 1936. On P‘s death, the holding devolved on P‘s widow, S. S died on 6-11-1956, and thereupon dispute about the inheritance to the land left behind by S arose between the parties. The plaintiff claimed that she being the daughter of T, a sister of the last male holder, P was an heir under Section 15 read with the Schedule referred to in Section 8  of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, whereas the defendants claimed as ―sapindas of the last male holder under Mitakshara law. Speaking for the Bench, Hon‘ble R.S. Sarkaria, J. held that the case would fall under clause Section 15(2)(b) because S died issueless and intestate and the interest in the suit property was inherited by her from her husband and the property would go to the heirs of the husband.<br><br>
In <b>State of Punjab v. Balwant Singh</b> , also, a question of similar nature was considered. In that case, the female Hindu inherited the property from her husband prior to the Hindu Succession Act and she died after the Act. On being informed that there was no heir entitled to succeed to her property, the Revenue Authorities affected mutation in favour of the State. There was no heir from her husband‘s side entitled to succeed to the property. The plaintiff, who was the grandson of the brother of the female Hindu claimed right over the property of the deceased. The High Court held that the property inherited by the female Hindu from her husband became her absolute property in view of Section 14 and the property would devolve upon the heirs specified under Section 15(1). The above view was held to be faulty and this Court did not accept that. It was held that it is important to remember that a female Hindu being the full owner of the property becomes a fresh stock of descent. If she leaves behind any heir either under sub-section (1) or under sub-section (2) of Section 15, her property cannot be escheated.<br><br>
 In <b>Amar Kaur v. Raman Kumari</b> , a contra-view was taken by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana. In this case, a widow inherited property from her husband in 1956. She had two daughters and the widow gifted the entire property in favour of her two daughters. One of the daughters named Shankari died without leaving a husband or descendant in 1972. Her property was mutated in favour of her other sister. At the time of Shankari's death, her husband had already died leaving behind another wife and a son. They claimed right over the property left by the deceased female Hindu. The learned Judge laid down in this case that Smt Shankari succeeded to life estate, which stood enlarged in her full ownership under Section 14(1) of the Act. Since smaller estates merged into larger one, the lesser estate ceased to exist and a new estate of full ownership by fiction of law came to be held for the first time by Smt Shankari. The estate, which she held under Section 14(1) of the Act, cannot be considered to be by virtue of inheritance from her mother or father. In law it would be deemed that she became full owner of this property by virtue of the Act. On these facts it is to be seen whether Section 15(1) of the Act will apply or Section 15(2) of the Act will apply. Section 15(2) of the Act will apply only when inheritance is to the estate left by father or mother, in the absence of which, Section 15(1) of the Act would apply. 
This view held by the single Judge was held incorrect in the opinion of the court and they were of the view that even if the female Hindu who is having a limited ownership becomes full owner by virtue of Section 14(1) of the Act, the rules of succession given under sub-section (2) of Section 15 can be applied. In fact, the Hindu Succession Bill, 1954 as originally introduced in the Rajya Sabha did not contain any clause corresponding to sub-section (2) of Section 15. It came to be incorporated on the recommendations of the Joint Committee of the two Houses of Parliament. The reason given by the Joint Committee is found in clause 17  of the Bill.<br><br>

<b>ISSUES:</b><br><br>
1.  Can a property which is inherited by a female Hindu from her mother, devolve on the female’s death, on the heir of her husband?<br><br>
<b>JUDGMENT:</b><br><br>
The court held that the property held by Smt. Santi was property inherited by her mother so clause (a) of Section 15(2) applied and Teja Singh who was the brother of Smt. Santi’s husband had no right in the property left by Smt. Santi. Her property would dissolve in the absence of any issue left by her, only on her sister, according to the court.<br><br>
It held: “The source from which the female inherits the property is always important and that would govern the situation. Otherwise persons who are not even remotely related to the persons who originally held the property would acquire the right to inherit the property. That would defeat the intent and purpose of Section 15(2) which gives a special pattern of succession”<br><br>
Bhagat Singh’s appeal was accordingly allowed, according to the court, the property devolved on the surviving sister Smt. Indro as the heir of the mother and not on the heirs of the pre-deceased husband of the deceased sister.
